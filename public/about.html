<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Olisajiokem (you can also call me Bright or Chukwuletam). I’m a certified Doctor of Optometry with a deep curiosity for health, wellness, and the human experience. Beyond my clinical work, I’m a passionate writer, currently exploring modern retellings of classic stories, blending speculative fiction with spiritual and philosophical themes.

<p>
  I’m also a novice web developer, eager to bring ideas to life online while learning Python programming along the way. I love making complex concepts simple and applying them in creative ways.

<p>
  When I’m not in the clinic or writing, you’ll find me thinking deeply about life, analyzing stories, or experimenting with ideas for healthier living and personal growth. I value honesty, curiosity, and challenging my own assumptions—and I enjoy connecting with people who do the same.
